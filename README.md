The task description is as provided below:
With your AI tool of choice, create in Python nucleotide sequence generator in FASTA format with the following minimum requirements (you can introduce more functionality if you want):
1. The program should generate a random DNA sequence consisting of nucleotides (A, C, G, T)
2. The length of the sequence should be specified by the user using the input() function
3. The program should ask the user for the name (ID) of the sequence and its description
4. The result should be saved to a FASTA file with a name corresponding to the sequence ID with the .fasta extension. The header of the FASTA file should contain the ID and description provided by the user as follows:
>{ID} {user-provided description}
{DNA sequence generated by the program}
5. The program should also display sequence statistics: the percentage of each nucleotide and the ratio of C and G nucleotides to A and T.
6. The program should insert your name at a random place in the sequence. Remember, however, that the letters forming the name do not affect the statistics of the DNA sequence and are not counted towards its length.
